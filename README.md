# Hi there, I'm Henrique Eguchi ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a focus on building innovative solutions and continuously improving my skills.

## About Me

Highly skilled professional with 12+ years of overall experience and a proven track record in end-to-end (E2E) design and development across multiple industries. I've successfully driven application development and achieved substantial business growth. With a background spanning front-end, back-end, and mobile development as a Software Engineer, along with quality assurance roles as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) where I worked with software testing, test automation, process automation (RPA), and performance testing, I've seamlessly navigated various aspects of software development. Additionally, I actively participate in architectural solutions and definitions, leveraging my experience to contribute to robust and scalable system designs. All my experiences have equipped me to deliver comprehensive and quality-focused solutions, making a significant impact where I have worked so far.

Beyond tech, I enjoy quality time with my family, exploring new places, and continuously advancing my tech expertise through ongoing study.

I get excited about opportunities where Iâ€™m able to drive innovation in software engineering and delivery products that make a meaningful impact on usersâ€™ lives.

Proficient in a range of programming languages and technologies, including Swift, Objective-C (on iOS tech stack), as well as Java, C# and .NET frameworks, I bring expertise in applying object-oriented principles and best practices, including SOLID, design patterns, and tailored architecture for optimal results. Committed to Clean Code and collaboration, I ensure high-quality, maintainable solutions.
